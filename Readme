Spring Boot Project
Overview
This project is a Spring Boot application developed as part of an academic exercise at Akademia Finans√≥w i Biznesu Vistula.
The application showcases the fundamental
 steps involved in creating a Spring Boot project, writing a Spring controller, and handling HTTP requests.

Features
Spring Boot Integration: Utilizes Spring Boot to streamline the setup and configuration of the application.
First Spring Controller: Implements a basic Spring controller to handle HTTP GET requests.
HTTP Request Handling: Demonstrates the use of the @ResponseBody annotation to return responses directly from the controller.
MVC Architecture: Incorporates elements of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to return views.
Thymeleaf Integration: Uses Thymeleaf as the template engine for rendering HTML views.
Static Resources: Includes static resources such as images to enhance the frontend.
Project Structure
Controller: Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and returning responses.
Templates: Holds the HTML files used for rendering views.
Static: Stores static resources like images.
Key Components
Controller
The controller is responsible for handling HTTP GET requests and returning responses. It includes endpoints such as /hello and /greeting.



Conclusion
This Spring Boot project serves as a practical example of setting up a Spring Boot application, creating controllers, handling HTTP requests,
and integrating
Thymeleaf for view rendering. It provides a solid foundation for further development and exploration of Spring Boot features.
